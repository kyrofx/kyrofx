<h5>Don't mind this horrible code, but to get to know me on here, I'm mostly interested in the backend aspects of web development. I am horrible with front end because I can't make anything look nice. I also do a bit of other stuff like java and other poopy languages. PHP is an okay language I use but its also not very great. ok bye</h5>
